Hello, if you are reading this you must want to try my new mod for Quake 4, Diablo in Quake. 

In order to install this mod, the first step is to create a folder with whatever name
you want in the same directory as the q4base folder. Then, take the game000.pak file from 
the q4base folder and add it to your new mod folder. After that, take the provided def files
and add them to a folder named "def" in the mod folder (remember to keep in the same 
order/hierarchy as they were provided). Finally, compile the code in the
git repository, take the Gamex86.dll and replace the Gamex86.dll file in the game000.pak
folder with the newly compiled one (you will need to unzip the pak file with an unzipping 
software). After this, all you need to is load up Quake4, go to the mods section, and choose
the name of the folder you created that contains the mod!

To play the game with this mod installed, play through the game's story normally, however 
there are more enemies and loot drops now! Also, weapons have been upgraded with more damage
and a bunch of other features, see if you can find out what they are! Finally, there are 
also elite enemies, that, on death, will have enemies come and fight you to avenge their
fallen leader!
